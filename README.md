# Introduction
This project seeks to create predictive models that can predict the home team and away team scores and if the match is a Win,Loss or Draw from the home team's perspective using Polynomial and Logistic Regression.

# Motivation
This project was done as a project for a Data Science Course.

# Summary of Analysis
The following steps were followed while conducting the analysis;

1.Defining the question.
2.Reading the Data.
3.Checking the data.
4.Data Cleaning.
5.Performing Explolatory Data Analysis-Univariate and Bivariate Analysis.
6.Prediction Models-Polynomial and Logistic Regression Models.
7.Challenging the solution.
8.Conclusion.

# Setup
Importing the relevant libraries to Google Colaboratory to be able to run code then loadiing the datsets,alternatively you could use Jupiter Notebook.
